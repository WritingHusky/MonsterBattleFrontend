# Monster Battling API

This is the front-end that interacts with the [Monster Battling API.](https://github.com/WritingHusky/MainBattleBuilder)

## Description

This is a very simple front-end so that I can show off the functionality of the [Monster Battling API](https://github.com/WritingHusky/MainBattleBuilder) in an interactive way. Because of this outlook I ask viewers to be gentle with any criticisms about the front-end as this is not my area of interest.

## Getting Started
